# Attention Mechanism Visualization

This is a placeholder for an attention mechanism diagram.

In a real implementation, this would be an actual PNG image showing:
- Query, Key, Value matrices
- Attention weights computation
- Multi-head attention structure
- Scaled dot-product attention mechanism

For now, this text serves as a placeholder. In practice, you would create or include actual diagram images here.
